		<h2>About Po</h2>
		<p>Master Po Ping (known simply as Po, and originally named Little Lotus) is the main protagonist of the Kung Fu Panda franchise. He is the adopted son of Mr. Ping and the biological son of Li Shan and his wife, as well as one of Master Shifu's students at the Jade Palace. He is also the foretold Dragon Warrior of legend, and a master of the Panda Style of kung fu.</p>

		<h2>Po's Characteristics</h2>
		<p>Po is bumbling, kind-hearted, and energetic. The Furious Five and Shifu are reluctant to engage with Po, who they (not unjustifiably) see as utterly incompetent. But, Po tries his best to approach the situation with enthusiasm and a positive attitude, gradually winning them over with his optimism and dedication during training.</p>
